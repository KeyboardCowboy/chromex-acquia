# ![Acquia Cloud Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeyboardCowboy/chromex-acquia/master/acquia_cloud.png) Acquia Clould Process Monitor
Google Chrome extension for Acquia Cloud to create notifications as processes change state.

## Usage
1. Install the plugin (you may need to enable developer mode)
2. Open your Acquia Cloud UI in a tab
3. Initiate a process.

You should see a Chrome notification with the process state.  As the state
changes (i.e. it finishes or fails) another notification will be generated.

## Roadmap
- Use the extension button to show a list of current, active processes.
